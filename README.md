As of right now, the game you are about to read about is still under development.


🎮 Patentero (also called tubigan, harangang-taga, or patintero) is one of the most popular traditional Filipino street games, so making a digital/web-based version would be both fun and culturally meaningful.

Patintero: Core Concept

Game Type: Traditional Filipino outdoor tag and strategy game.
Teams: Two teams (Runners and Guards) compete on a marked rectangular grid court.
Runners' Goal: Cross all lines of the grid (start to end and back) to score a point without being tagged.
Guards' Restriction: Guards must stay on their assigned line and must have **both feet on the line** to successfully tag a Runner.
Tag Result: If a Runner is tagged, teams switch roles (turnover).
